        "content": "Trump and JD [Vance](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/vance-trump-2020-election-b2623517.html), along with most of the rest of the Republican party, continue to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was \"stolen\", which Trump first began to tell a few weeks before the 2020 election. As [conservative legal experts](https://lostnotstolen.org/), [Stanford researchers](https://www.cato.org/blog/two-scholars-revisit-trumps-election-fraud-claims), and many other analysts have shown, these are lies. Not only lies, but transparent lies. From the Stanford report:\n\n> At no point did Trump or his allies present even remotely plausible evidence of consequential fraud or illegality.\n\nNone of these cases showed any significant vote or election fraud, and [most](https://campaignlegal.org/results-lawsuits-regarding-2020-elections) were found to be without any merit. While there's nothing illegal or even necessarily wrong with challenging election results in court, the basis of these challenges were lies, which Trump and the GOP continue to endorse. In part fueled by those lies, the Republican party attempted to overthrow the 2020 election and appoint Trump for a second term. Those events culminated most dramatically on January 6th, when, according to the [January 6th committee](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/html-submitted/index.html):\n\n> Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for January 6th. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on January 6th to \u201ctake back\u201d their country.\n\nHowever, the attempts to overturn the 2020 election were not limited to the riot on January 6th. The [new filing](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/trump-jan-6-case-jack-smith-evidence.html?unlocked_article_code=1.PU4.Phgi.FCBFT7VUGWWs&smid=url-share) by Jack Smith's team in the case charging Trump with attempting to overthrow the election adds new details, in addition to confirming the findings of the January 6th Committee's report. The plot also was much larger than the riots of January 6th. The indictment and [other reporting](https://americanoversight.org/investigation/the-alternate-electors-plot-to-overturn-the-2020-election/) has detailed the \"fake electors\" scheme, in addition to attempts to overturn the votes of individual states. Some of these attempts have resulted in [criminal convictions](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-election-denier-tina-peters-sentenced-to-9-years-in-prison-for-voting-data-scheme). The plot (or plots) to overturn the election were not supported by all Republicans, with key Republican elected officials and judges refusing to comply. Many, however, did, including [147 congress members](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html). Since then, many Republicans who opposed Trump have been replaced with [election deniers](https://electiondeniers.org/), and many Republicans who originally condemned January 6th have [since recanted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/).\n\nMultiple plots by Republicans to overturn the 2024 election are already [known to be underway](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republican_Party_efforts_to_disrupt_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election&oldid=1248655479#False_allegations_of_rigged_election). Trump is both the Republican presidential nominee and de-facto [leader of the RNC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-officially-takes-over-republican-national-committee-rcna142362), so these plots aren't just fringe groups, they are backed by the Republican Party and [financed by](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/heritage-foundation-election-voting-rights-republican-states) wealthy conservative groups and individuals. While [many Republicans](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/03/harris-anti-trump-republicans-2024-endorsements) have endorsed Harris, in part because of these attempts to overturn the election, nearly all of them are \"former\" elected officials, or those who are not seeking re-election. [70% of Republican voters](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/cnn-poll-republicans-think-2020-election-illegitimate/index.html) claim Biden lost the 2020 election.\n\nElection integrity experts have identified [many points of vulnarability](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/us/politics/republican-election-campaign-2024.html?unlocked_article_code=1.PU4.D5K8.v8X7iDz7UocB&smid=url-share) in the US election system, presenting a large attack surface rather than a single point of failure. This also allows individual actors to attack races at the destrict, state, and national levels without needing to coordinate directly.

As it happened so close to the presidential election, the federal government's response to Helene has become a big political issue, with Republicans criticizing the Biden administration's response to the hurricane. This has come with some misinformation, e.g. [the false claim](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery) that hurricane victims are only receiving $750 from FEMA (there are other FEMA programs that help victims in addition to the $750 program). Democrats have largely deflected criticism towards Republicans, making the point that many Republicans [voted against increasing FEMA funding](https://www.latintimes.com/hurricane-helene-florida-fema-relief-republicans-voted-matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-nancy-mace-560943) right before Helene made landfall. In the midst of this partisan discussion, something that I think has been overlooked is the *actual* state of the federal government's response to Helene.\n\nAt the same time, there may be legitimate concerns about the response to Helene that are being overlooked in partisan discussions. For example, in the aftermath of Helene, FEMA faces the risk of [running out of money](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-congress-fema-funding-5be4f18e00ce2b509d6830410cf2c1cb) before the end of the hurricane season, which was also an issue [last year](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/30/fema-disaster-low-funds-00113468) and at [other points in the past](https://money.cnn.com/2011/08/29/news/economy/fema_funds_hurricane_irene/index.htm). Earlier this year, FEMA [changed its rules](https://apnews.com/article/fema-disaster-assistance-7291e5b45c8246266613ba8d8bec75de) to better respond to hurricanes, but those changes came with an estimated $671 million annual cost which FEMA may not be able to afford without more funding. These rules were in effect for Helene, but not for past hurricanes.\n\n**These are my questions: What is the actual state of the federal government's response to Hurricane Helene? What have been the biggest shortfalls of the federal government's response to Helene (especially compared to past hurricanes like Idalia, Ian, and Ida)?**",

I'd highly recommend reading it before responding to my post.

They are:\n\n**Kamala Harris**    \nParty: Democratic    \nPolicy page: https://kamalaharris.com/issues/     \n\n**Donald Trump**    \nParty: Republican    \nPolicy page: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform    \n\n**Chase Oliver**    \nParty: Libertarian    \nPolicy page: https://votechaseoliver.com/platform/      \n\n**Jill Stein**   \nParty: Green   \nPolicy page: https://www.jillstein2024.com/platform\n\nA number of other candidates have [partial ballot access,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election#With_partial_ballot_access) meaning not enough to win a majority in the electoral college.\n\n------\n\n**Voting FAQ:**\n\n*Q: Am I eligible to vote?*    \nA: If you are a U.S. citizen who will be at least 18 years old on the day of the election, you are likely [eligible to vote.](https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote)\n\n*Q: Is it too late to register to vote?*     \nA: It depends. A few states' deadlines have passed, others are approaching, and a few allow registration up until the same day as the election. [Look up your state's information here.](https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/)\n\n*Q: Where do I vote on Election Day?*     \nA: Voters are assigned a polling place based on the address where they're registered. Find your polling place [here](https://www.headcount.org/find-your-polling-place/) or [here.](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)\n\n*Q: What are the hours of my polling place?*     \nA: [Find the opening and closing times for your polling place here.](https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_\\(2024\\))\n\n*Q: Do I need to show identification to vote?*     \nA: Most states require some form of identification when you register and/or when you vote. The rules vary state by state. [This interactive map will help you determine the requirements for your state.](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id#anchor12536)\n\n*Q: Can anyone find out how I voted?*    \nA: No. Your vote is confidential. You enter the booth alone and make your choices in private. If your polling place gives some kind of receipt, it will only indicate *that* you voted, not *how* you voted. \n\n*Q: What if I go to the polls and they tell me I am not registered to vote?*     \nA: Per [this site:](https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/voting-faqs/) First, make sure you are at the right polling place. If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.\n\n*Q: On Election Day, if I think my rights have been violated, what should I do?*    \nA: Call or text the Election Protection Hotline at 866-687-8683. There will be lawyers on hand to answer Election Day questions and concerns about voting procedures.\n\n*Q: Can I vote if I'm out of the country?*    \nA: Yes. U.S. citizens who will be over 18 on election day may vote even if they're traveling, serving, or residing outside the country. The specific rules for overseas voters vary based on a number of factors. More information can be found through the [Federal Voting Assistance Program.](https://www.fvap.gov/)\n\n*Q: Do I have to wait until election day to vote?*     \nA: Probably not. Early voting has begun, or will soon begin, in all states that have it. Check the [rules and deadlines for your particular state here,](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/early-voting-dates) noting that early voting *ends* before election day in some states.\n\n*Q: Do I have to be registered with the party of the candidate I want to vote for?*    \nA: No. In general elections, you can vote for any candidate of any party, no matter your personal affiliation. Depending on the state where you're registered, primary elections may be different, but those have all passed for this cycle.\n\n*Q: Do I need to vote on every candidate and issue in order for my ballot to be valid?*    \nA: No. Your ballot is valid even if you decline to vote on specific races or questions. Your vote will still be counted in the contests where you voted.\n\n*Q: May I bring notes and/or a sample ballot into the voting booth?*    \nA: Yes, you're allowed to bring notes with you, but some polling places restrict the use of cell phones, so notes should be on paper.\n\n*Q: Where can I learn more about the candidates and issues on my ballot?*    \nA: For ballot initiatives, your Secretary of State's office will usually send a voter information booklet and sample ballot, which may also be available on their website. Check [BallotReady](https://www.ballotready.org/) to find yours.\n\nFor comparisons of the candidates, these sites are useful:\n\n* [ISideWith,](https://www.isidewith.com/) \"the world\u2019s most popular voting guide for citizens to find information about elections, political parties, candidates, voting districts and popular political issues in their country.\"\n* [Ballotpedia,](https://ballotpedia.org/) \"the digital encyclopedia of American politics, and the nation\u2019s premier resource for unbiased information on elections, politics, and policy.\"\n* [VOTE 411,](https://www.vote411.org/ballot) \"Personalized Ballot and Candidate Information.\"\n* [We Vote,](https://wevote.us/) \"a digital voter guide.\"\n* [ProCon.org](https://2024election.procon.org/side-by-side-comparison-chart/) Side-by-Side Comparison Chart.\n* [Open Secrets,](https://www.opensecrets.org/) \"the nation's premier research group tracking money in U.S. politics and its effect on elections and public policy.\"\n\n----\n\n*This is an informational post for our users.*",

        "content": "I went to my county Board of Elections yesterday to vote early. Have to say after my experience I'm pretty worried.... I know the rules are no campaigning within 100ft of the building. Yet, there were multiple Democrat campaigners campaigning literally 20ft from the main entrance. Security was right there and they did nothing. I waited to see if they were asked to leave by the time I came out (almost an hour standing in line and voting). But they weren't. I had to go to security and tell them those people are not supposed to be doing that. Security told me they would take care of it, so I drove around the block and they finally asked them to leave. But there was another one only 15ft away from the first. It was definately not 100ft, so I drove up to the same security guy and told him about the second one. He just said \"OK, I'll take care of it\". I slowly started driving away and he never got on his phone like the first one. Tried to tell another campaigner to call whoever they know to stop it, and I left. Made me angry to be honest. On top of it, every single poll worker there I honestly felt was a Democrat. Don't ask me how I knew, I can't tell you. It just seemed pretty obvious. I think they felt they knew I was a Republican voter and kind of \" cold shouldered\" me, just seemed to treat me different. Plus, when I went to scan in my ballot the guy directing people was trying to look at my ballot to see who I voted for. Honestly, I don't trust these people and I don't think the board of elections reinforce the rules to these people enough. The entire experience didn't feel right and I am pretty worried more of the same shennanigans are going to happen this election. How do you prove these electuon workers are biased and willing to commit low key underhanded crimes? I feel like the only way to get it under control is if a crackdown is made so these volunteers understand how serious their jobs are. How much trouble they can get into fucking around.... Also, they were ringing bells and celebrating first time voters everytime they went up to the window to get their ballot. I felt like that was a bit over the top. Maybe I'm over reacting but there shouldn't be any emotions and parties happening, it should be very strict and serious at a board of elections.",

It\u2019s good to be with you, Bret.\n\nBret Baier:\nVoters tell pollsters all over the country and here in Pennsylvania that immigration is one of the key issues that they\u2019re looking at this election and specifically the influx of illegal immigrants from more than 150 countries. How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three-and-half years?\n\nKamala Harris:\nWell, I\u2019m glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you. It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have and you know what I\u2019m going to talk about right now, which is-\n\nBret Baier :\nYeah, but just a number. Do you think\u2019s 1 million? 3 million?\n\nKamala Harris :\nBret, let\u2019s just get to the point. Okay. The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired.\n\nBret Baier :\nYour Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions-\n\nKamala Harris :\nBut I\u2019m not finished, I\u2019m not finished. We have an immigration system-\n\nBret Baier :\nIt\u2019s a rough estimate of 6 million-\n\nKamala Harris : \n\u2026 that needs to be\u2026\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 people have been released into the country. And let me just finish. I\u2019ll get to the question, I promise you.\n\nKamala Harris :\nI was beginning to answer.\n\nBret Baier :\nAnd when you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border policies, most significantly, the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation either in the US or in Mexico. And you switched that policy, they were released from custody awaiting trial. So instead, included in those were a large number of single men, adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?\n\nKamala Harris :\nAt the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill that we offered Congress, before we worked on infrastructure, before the Inflation Reduction Act, before the Chips and Science Act, before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system.\n\nBret Baier :\nYes, ma\u2019am. It was called the US Citizenship Act of 2021.\n\nKamala Harris :\nExactly.\n\nBret Baier :\nIt was essentially a pathway to citizenship for the-\n\nKamala Harris :\nMay I please finish?\n\nBret Baier :\nYes, ma\u2019am.\n\nKamala Harris :\nMay I finish responding please?\n\nBret Baier :\nBut here, but this-\n\nKamala Harris :\nBut you have to let me finish, please.\n\nBret Baier :\nYou had the White House and the House and the Senate and they didn\u2019t bring up that bill.\n\nKamala Harris :\nI\u2019m in the middle responding to the point you\u2019re raising.\n\nBret Baier :\nOkay.\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd I\u2019d like to finish.\n\nBret Baier :\nYes, ma\u2019am.\n\nKamala Harris :\nWe recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. And our focus has been on fixing a problem. And from day one then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border entry points. That\u2019s the work we did.And we worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the border patrol agents supported the bill. It would\u2019ve allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people. It would\u2019ve allowed us to put more resources into prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, which I have done-\n\nBret Baier :\nYes, ma\u2019am\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 as the attorney general, former attorney general of a border state.\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President, a couple things.\n\nKamala Harris :\nProsecuted trafficking of drugs, guns, and human beings. And Donald Trump-\n\nBret Baier :\nSix Democrats-\n\nKamala Harris :\nBut let me just finish. And Donald Trump-\n\nBret Baier :\nSix Democrats voted against that bill.\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And in this election, this is rightly a discussion that the American people want to have and what they want are solutions and they want a president of the United States who\u2019s not playing political games with the issue-\n\nBret Baier :\nI hear you.\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 but actually is focused on fixing it.\n\nBret Baier :\nSix Democrats voted against that bill. It would\u2019ve allowed 1.8 million illegal immigrants into the country a year. A lot of conservatives had a problem with it. These are the six Democrats. But more importantly, back to the original premise, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration, well before a negotiated bipartisan bill. Former President Clinton actually referred to Laken Riley Sunday, campaigning for you in Georgia, saying if those men had been properly vetted, Laken Riley probably would not have been killed.So it wouldn\u2019t have happened. This is well before any negotiation. This is well before Donald Trump got involved in the politics. This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I\u2019m saying to you, do you-\n\nKamala Harris :\nNo, no, Bret. I think it\u2019s really-\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 owe those families an apology?\n\nKamala Harris :\nLet me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There\u2019s no question about that. There is no question about that and I can\u2019t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would\u2019ve had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together-\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 to ensure that no future harm would occur. And this election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution, Bret.\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President, it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration. I will let one of the mothers talk about it. Take a listen.\n\nSpeaker 3 (mother of victim) :\n\u201cBecause of the Biden-Harris administration open border policy\u2019s catch and release, they were enrolled in the alternatives to detention program. This meant that they were released into the United States. It was not even a full three weeks later that they would take my daughter, Jocelyn Nungaray\u2019s life. I believe the Biden-Harris administration open border policies are responsible for the death of my daughter\u201d\n\nBret Baier :\nThat\u2019s the early days. So do you owe them an apology? Is what I\u2019m saying.\n\nKamala Harris :\nI will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I\u2019m so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let\u2019s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. Let\u2019s talk about that as well, Bret.\n\nBret Baier :\nBut do you want to answer her?\n\nKamala Harris :\nIn all fairness. I told you I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.\n\nBret Baier :\nDuring that time, you said repeatedly that the border was secure. When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis?\n\nKamala Harris :\nI think we\u2019ve had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump\u2019s administration, even before. Let\u2019s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I\u2019ve been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed. We need more\u2026I was just down at the border, talking with border agents and they will tell you, and I\u2019m sure you probably, I know you investigate and you are a serious journalist, they will tell you we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for those cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that\u2019s going to get fixed, Bret. That\u2019s how the system works.\n\nBret Baier :\nThat\u2019s the premise of this question.\n\nKamala Harris :\nBut that\u2019s how the system works.\n\nBret Baier :\nThere were 90 plus executive orders that were rescinded in the first days. Many of those were Trump border policies. I\u2019m not going to stay here because there\u2019s other things to talk about, but you frequently talked to the Border Patrol Union for support of that bipartisan bill and they did. They supported it, but they also just endorsed Donald Trump and said you\u2019ve been \u201ca failure with border security.\u201d Why do you think they said that?\n\nKamala Harris :\nI think they\u2019re frustrated and I get it. They want support. They want support, and that\u2019s what that border security bill would\u2019ve done. These guys down at the border, these men and women, they\u2019re working hard. They\u2019re working around the clock. I get it.\n\nBret Baier :\nThere\u2019s a lot of people that look back at what you said in 2019 when you first ran for president. And there have been changes and you\u2019ve talked about some of them. When it comes to immigration, you supported allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver\u2019s license, to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free healthcare. Do you still support those things?\n\nKamala Harris :\nListen, that was five years ago and I\u2019m very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again and as vice president of the United States, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve done, not to mention before.\n\nBret Baier :\nIf that\u2019s the case, you chose a running mate, Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota, who signed those very things into state law. So do you support that?\n\nKamala Harris :\nWe are very clear and I am very clear, as is Tim Walz, that we must support and enforce federal law and that is exactly what we will do.\n\nBret Baier :\nDecriminalizing border crossings, like you said in 2019-\n\nKamala Harris :\nI do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I\u2019ve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president.\n\nBret Baier :\nSo these are evolutions that you\u2019ve had.\n\nKamala Harris :\nWell, let\u2019s be very clear. I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s running for president who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, from the Sinaloa Cartel, to the Guadalajara Cartel, to people who have trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career going after people who present a threat to the safety of the American people and cross our border with the intent of doing us harm and cross our border illegally. And I will do that work as vice president, I take that work quite seriously.\n\nBret Baier :\nThis is a time when voters, especially here in Pennsylvania, are inundated with commercials and ads. They just want it to stop because it\u2019s every commercial. But many of them add noise, but a few of them seem to break through. This particular one from the Trump campaign has gotten a lot of attention.\n\nSpeaker 4 (Trump Ad) :\nKamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.\nKamala Harris (Trump Ad) :\n\u201cFor prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access\u201d\n\nBret Baier :\nSo are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?\n\nKamala Harris :\nI will follow the law and it\u2019s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You\u2019re probably familiar with now it\u2019s a public report that under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you\u2019re living in a glass house.\n\nBret Baier :\nThe Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition surgeries happened during his presidency.\n\nKamala Harris :\nWell, you got to take responsible for what happened in your administration.\n\nBret Baier :\nYeah, no surgeries happened in his presidency.\n\nKamala Harris :\nIt\u2019s in black and white.\n\nBret Baier :\nWould you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgeries?\n\nKamala Harris :\nI would follow the law, just as-\n\nBret Baier :\nWell, you have a say in as-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 I think Donald Trump would say he did.\n\nBret Baier :\nYou would have a say as president.\n\nKamala Harris :\nLike I said, I think it\u2019s\u2026 He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people. Whereas $20 million on that ad, on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it\u2019s really quite remote. And again, his policy was no different. Look at where we are though.\n\nBret Baier :\nThey say it was different, but let\u2019s, we\u2019ll move on.\n\nKamala Harris :\nOn plans for the American people, I\u2019m offering a plan to deal with affordable housing. I\u2019m offering a plan to deal with what we need to do to strengthen small businesses which are the backbone of America\u2019s economy. I am offering a plan that is about taking care of young parents and giving them the support they need. My plans for the economy will strengthen the economy, as have been reviewed by 16 Nobel Laureates, Goldman Sachs, Moody\u2019s, and recently the Wall Street Journal, which have all studied our plans and have indicated my plans for our economy would strengthen our economy. His would make them weaker, would ignite-\n\nBret Baier :\nWhy do you think more people say-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. Those are the facts.\n\nBret Baier :\nWhy do you think more people say they trust him on the economy than they trust you?\n\nKamala Harris :\nI think that when you look at an analysis of our plans for what we would do as president of the United States, it has been clear to those who study and understand how economic policy works that moving forward, because I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump, people are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a president who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen our country. My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be again to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit.\n\nBret Baier :\nIt\u2019s interesting you said turn the page, Madam Vice President. You were asked on two different shows last week, what, if anything, you would do differently than President Biden? Here\u2019s what you said.\n\nSpeaker 6 (prior interview) :\nWould you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?\nKamala Harris (prior interview) :\n\u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of\u2026 And I\u2019ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact\u201d\nStephen Colbert (prior interview) :\nUnder a Harris administration, what would the major changes be? And what would stay the same?\nKamala Harris (prior interview) :\n\u201cSure. Well, I\u2019m obviously not Joe Biden\u201d\nStephen Colbert (prior interview) :\nI noticed. \nKamala Harris (prior interview) :\n\u201cSo that would be one change in terms of\u2026 But also, I think it\u2019s important to say with 28 days to go, I\u2019m not Donald Trump\u201d\n\nBret Baier :\nSo you\u2019re not Joe Biden, you\u2019re not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently?\n\nKamala Harris :\nLet me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make about, for example, my plan for increasing the supply of housing in America and bringing down the cost of housing, addressing the issue of small businesses, which is about working with the private sector to bring more capital and access to capital to our small business leaders, including my plan for a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and for small businesses, extending the tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000.\n\nBret Baier :\nWe\u2019ve heard a lot about those plans in recent days. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward and it\u2019s time to turn the page. You\u2019ve been vice president for three and a half years, so what are you turning the page from?\n\nKamala Harris :\nWell, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know, the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up.\n\nBret Baier :\nBut you, Madam Vice President-\n\nKamala Harris :\nThe strength of an American president, which is one who understands that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. That is turning the page-\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President, more than 70% of people tell pollsters-\n\nKamala Harris :\nThat is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Bret. People are exhausted.\n\nBret Baier :\nMore than 70% of people tell the country is on the wrong track. They say the country is on the wrong track. If it\u2019s on the wrong track, that track follows three and a half years of you being vice president and President Biden being president. That is what they\u2019re saying, 79% of them. Why are they saying that? If you\u2019re turning the page, you\u2019ve been in office for three and a half years.\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd Donald Trump has been running for office since-\n\nBret Baier :\nBut you\u2019ve been the person holding the office.\n\nKamala Harris :\nCome on, come on.\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President-\n\nKamala Harris :\nYou and I both know what I\u2019m talking about. You and I both know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nBret Baier :\nI actually don\u2019t. What are you talking about?\n\nKamala Harris :\nWhat I\u2019m talking about is that over the last decade, people have become-\n\nBret Baier :\nBut you\u2019re the lever of power.\n\nKamala Harris :\nBut listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former chief of staff to the President Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president, one, that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances and it being about him instead of-\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 instead the American people.\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 if that\u2019s the case-\n\nKamala Harris :\nPeople are tired of that.\n\nBret Baier :\nIf that\u2019s the case, why is half the country supporting him? Why is he beating you in a lot of swing states? Why, if he\u2019s as bad as you say, that half of this country is now supporting this person who could be the 47th president of the United States? Why is that happening?\n\nKamala Harris :\nThis is an election for president of the United States. It\u2019s not supposed to be easy.\n\nBret Baier :\nI know, but it is-\n\nKamala Harris :\nIt is not supposed to be a cakewalk for anyone.\n\nBret Baier :\nSo are they misguided, the 50%?\n\nKamala Harris :\nListen, let-\n\nBret Baier :\nAre they stupid? What is it?\n\nKamala Harris :\nOh, God. I would never say that about the American people. And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he\u2019s the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He\u2019s the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people.\n\nBret Baier :\nWe asked that question to the former president today. Harris Faulkner had a town hall and this is how he responded.\n\nDonald Trump (town hall) :\n\u201cI heard about that. They were saying I was threatening. I\u2019m not threatening anybody. They\u2019re the ones doing the threatening. They do phony investigations. I\u2019ve been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the greatest gangster-\u201c\nHarris Faulkner (town hall) :\nOh my goodness.\nDonald Trump (town hall) :\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s true\u201d\nHarris Faulkner (town hall) :\nAll right. \nDonald Trump (town hall) :\n\u201cBut think of it. It\u2019s called weaponization of government. It\u2019s a terrible thing\u201d\n\nKamala Harris :\nBret, I\u2019m sorry, and with all due respect, that clip was not what he has been saying about the enemy within, that he has repeated when he\u2019s speaking about the American people. That\u2019s not what you just showed.\n\nBret Baier :\nWell, he was asked about that specific-\n\nKamala Harris :\nNo, no, no. That\u2019s not what you just showed, in all fairness-\n\nBret Baier :\nNo, no, no.\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 and respect to you.\n\nBret Baier :\nI\u2019m telling you that was the question that we asked him.\n\nKamala Harris :\nYou didn\u2019t show that and here\u2019s the bottom line. He has repeated it many times and you and I both know that. And you and I both know that he has talked about turning the American military on the American people. He has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest. He has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him.This is a democracy and in a democracy, the president of the United States, in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle criticism without saying he\u2019d lock people up for doing it. And this is what is at stake, which is why you have someone like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying what Mark Milley has said about Donald Trump being a threat to the United States of America.\n\nBret Baier :\nHe\u2019s quoted in the Bob Woodward book that way, yes. Let me ask you this, Madam Vice President.\n\nKamala Harris :\nBut let\u2019s not-\n\nBret Baier :\nYou call Donald Trump-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 diminish the significance of that.\n\nBret Baier :\nYou call Donald Trump, he\u2019s misguided. You say now he\u2019s-\n\nKamala Harris :\nHe\u2019s unstable.\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 unstable.\n\nKamala Harris :\nHe is unstable, Bret.\n\nBret Baier :\nHe\u2019s not well, you say he is mentally not stable.\n\nKamala Harris :\nHe\u2019s not stable.\n\nBret Baier :\nLet me ask you this.\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd we should all be concerned.\n\nBret Baier :\nYou told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, that ran around circles on his staff. When did you first notice that President Biden\u2019s mental faculties appeared diminished?\n\nKamala Harris :\nJoe Biden, I have watched in from the Oval Office to the situation room, and he has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden-\n\nBret Baier :\nThere were no concerns raised?\n\nKamala Harris :\nBret, Joe Biden is not on ballot.\n\nBret Baier :\nI understand, but-\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd Donald Trump is-\n\nBret Baier :\nBut you talked about it.\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd Donald Trump is.\n\nBret Baier :\nAfter George Clooney said within a few minutes of-\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd if you watch Donald Trump-\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 talking to President Biden at a fundraiser, that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden that we saw on the debate stage.\n\nKamala Harris :\nDonald Trump is on the ballot.\n\nBret Baier :\nI understand. You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. You didn\u2019t have any concerns?\n\nKamala Harris :\nI think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump, which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community, have all spoken out. Even people who worked for him in the Oval Office, worked with him in the situation room, and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again, including his former vice president, which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate. So that is a fact. That is a fact.\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President, two more things. You were asked on 60 Minutes about the biggest threat that the world faces, that the US faces. This is what you said.\n\nBill Whitaker (prior interview) :\nWhich foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?\nKamala Harris (prior interview):\nI think there\u2019s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands. Okay? This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.\n\nBret Baier :\nA number of experts thought you would say China, the FBI director had said that, but you said Iran. If that\u2019s the case, what do you say to critics who look at the actions of your administration and say you\u2019re not acting like Iran is the number one threat?\n\nKamala Harris :\nWell, I will tell you most recently, whether it was in April or in October, and then several hours on each occasion, that Iran posed a threat to Israel. I was there, most recently in the situation room in the most recent attack, working with the heads of our military in doing what America must always do to defend and to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself and to give American support, to be able to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself against attack, including from Iran and Iran\u2019s terrorist proxies in the region.\n\nBret Baier :\nRight.\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd that is-\n\nBret Baier :\nBut those proxies were getting funded by Iran.\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd my commitment to that is unyielding and unwavering.\n\nBret Baier :\nCritics just say that you either relaxed or failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, allowing all of this money to flow into Iran, like billions in oil profits.\n\nKamala Harris :\nBut let\u2019s go back to Donald Trump, who-\n\nBret Baier :\nHold on, that-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 pulled out of a deal that would\u2019ve actually put Iran in check.\n\nBret Baier :\nThe estimate\u2019s in billions.\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd then it was during Donald Trump\u2019s administration that Iran-\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 that go towards the Iran regime.\n\nKamala Harris :\nThat we had an American military base that was attacked, where American soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries and Donald Trump dismissed them as headaches. Not to mention how Donald Trump has-\n\nBret Baier :\nMadame Vice President, all of this money-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 treated and talked about-\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 that has gone in the past few years-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 America\u2019s military and military service people, calling-\n\nBret Baier :\nCritics say-\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 them suckers and losers.\n\nBret Baier :\n\u2026 that it goes to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis.\n\nKamala Harris :\nHas diminished the significance-\n\nBret Baier :\nWe\u2019re talking over each other, I apologize.\n\nKamala Harris :\nWell, and I wish-\n\nBret Baier :\nBut you\u2019re not-\n\nKamala Harris :\nI would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in full assessment of the facts, which includes, I think this interview is supposed to be about the choices that your viewers should be presented about this election and the contrast is important.\n\nBret Baier :\nYes, ma\u2019am. And we-\n\nKamala Harris :\nAnd on this subject of Iran, I am offering what should be an important contrast that is presented for folks to make a decision that they feel-\n\nBret Baier :\nAnd there are critics who look at what the administration did and think differently. Madam Vice President, they\u2019re wrapping me very hard here. I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. There are a lot of things-\n\nKamala Harris :\nThere\u2019s more to say. I have much more to say, actually.\n\nBret Baier :\nThere are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies.\n\nKamala Harris :\nYes,\n\nBret Baier :\nAnd that\u2019s why we invited you her.\n\nKamala Harris :\nI invite everyone to go to KamalaHarris.com and you will see that I have 80 pages of policies that are quite comprehensive and should be accessible to anyone who would like to read them. And it includes what I intend to do about affordable housing, what I intend to do about small businesses, what I intend to do to-\n\nBret Baier :\nAnd that\u2019s why we invited you here.\n\nKamala Harris :\n\u2026 strengthen our economy.\n\nBret Baier :\nTo see where you were in 2019 and where you are now.\n\nKamala Harris :\nTo support America\u2019s military and ensure we have the most lethal and best fighting force in the world.\n\nBret Baier :\nMadam Vice President, they\u2019re giving me a hard wrap here.\n\nKamala Harris :\nWell, I thank you for the time.\n\nBret Baier :\nI thank you for the time.\n\nKamala Harris :\nIt\u2019s good to meet you.\n\nBret Baier :\nThank you very much.\n\nKamala Harris :\nThank you.\n\nEnd \n",

(538, economist, Nate Silver's model at his sub stack) and Silver has at least said at this point he'd rather be Harris with the polls he is seeing. \n\nHowever we have two very clear data points with Trump on the ballot. In 2016 Trump pulled off a win when almost no one thought he had a chance. And in 2020 Biden had a clear win, but it ended up being *far* closer than the polls. In fact, projections the day before the election were that Biden would score pretty comfortable wins in the Blue wall and also pick up wins in FL and NC. Reviewing the polls of FL in particular shows Biden consistently being up 3-6 points. \n\nhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/\n\nFor reference here is the final 538 projection but to summarize it gave Biden a 90% chance to win with likely wins in FL and NC and Iowa and TX being closish. Biden ended up losing FL pretty convincingly, and the polls were off by a good 5 points or so. \n\nCurrently, all polling seems to show a super narrow Harris lead, often within the margin of error, even in the Blue wall states and Trump with clear leads in AZ, FL and more of a toss up in GA and NC. \n\nMy question is:  Is there any objective reason or evidence to believe the polls are *not* once again underestimating Trump's support? They have under called Trump's vote by 3-5 points twice so far, why won't it happen again? I'm not looking for vibes or political reasons to vote a particular way, but more of a discussion on why we should, to be blunt, trust the polls to get it right this time.  ",

It seems to argument for being Pro-Choice was that Government had no right to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her body. This seems to be the small-government decision.\n\nRoe V. Wade itself was passed by a heavily Republican seem court headed by Republican Chief Justice Warren E. Burger as well as Justices Harry Blackmun, Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist.\n\nNot only that but Mr. Conservative himself Barry Goldwater was Pro-Choice. As were Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, the Rockefellers, etc as were most Republican Congressmen, Senators and Governors in the 1950s, 60s, 70s and into the 80s.\n\nWhile not really Pro-Choice or Pro-Life himself to Ronald Reagan abortion was kind of a non-issue. He spent his administration with other issues.\n\nHowever, in the late 80s and 90s the Conservatives did a 180 and turned full circle into being pro-life. The rise of Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan and the Bush family, it seems the conservatives became pro-life and heavily so. Same with the conservative media through Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, etc.\n\nSo why did this dramatic change occur? Shouldn't the Republican party switch back?",

Here are some quotes from Walz talking about it back in February:\n\n* https://x.com/ArthurDelaneyHP/status/1820821417363152916\n\nThis is contrasted by the Republicans' positions, with them gradually opposing some of these services as they get caught in the crossfire of their anti-abortion agenda. For instance, some Republicans have been moving against IVF lately because it can create multiple embryos, some of which get discarded. An Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year put access in jeopardy there, and the other week Republicans blocked a bill to protect IVF access nationwide:\n\n* https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/senate-ivf-bill-vote/index.html\n\nI wonder if that vote affects JD Vance in particular though.

But in contrast to Walz' personal story with fertility treatments, Vance missed the vote to protect IVF as he did not show up to Congress that day.

It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.\n\nSo with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?",

Williams was convicted of murder in 2001, but significant concerns have emerged regarding the fairness of his trial and his actual guilt.\n\nFormer Missouri Governor Eric Greitens paused the execution in 2017 and formed a special board to review the evidence, indicating there was enough doubt to warrant further investigation. Additionally, new DNA evidence, along with mishandling of key evidence like the murder weapon, has raised more questions about the conviction. The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney has also expressed concerns that Williams\u2019 constitutional rights were violated, and the victim\u2019s widower has opposed the death penalty in this case.\n\nDespite these issues, Governor Parson disbanded the board in 2022 and initiated efforts to set an execution date, which is now scheduled for today. I\u2019m curious about the rationale behind this decision, especially given the ongoing concerns about potential innocence. What might have driven Governor Parson\u2019s decision to move forward with the execution?\n\nAny insight or explanations would be appreciated.",

Will the right accept defeat in 2024 if it comes or try to take a more militant stance?\n\n2. If the right wins will it attempt to win a larger coalition by moderating its views or embrace a vision of overthrowing the status-quo? e.g the 2025 plan \n\n3. Has the experience of running unelectable candidates in winnable states (Lake, Robinson) begun to sour the right on a lack of political pragmatism?\n\n4. Will the right fight or concede on it's unpopular stance on trying to limit abortion?\n\n  \nThe Left: \n\n1. Will the Liberal-Left try to push America towards a more progressive cultural understanding or attempt to consolidate post 2010s gains at the expense of further equity efforts or concede some post 2010s gain in an effort to gain control of the center?\n\n2.

        "title": "(New York Times) How One Polling Decision Is Leading to Two Distinct Stories of the Election.\nA methodological choice has created divergent paths of polling results. Is this election more like 2020 or 2022?",
        "content": "***Source***: [*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html) ***(Paywall)***\n\nOver the last month, one methodological decision seems to have produced two parallel universes of political polling.\n\nIn one universe, Kamala Harris leads only narrowly in the national popular vote against Donald J. Trump, even as she holds a discernible edge in the Northern battlegrounds. The numbers look surprisingly similar to the 2022 midterm election.\n\nIn the other, Ms. Harris has a clear lead in the national vote, but the battlegrounds are very tight. It\u2019s essentially a repeat of the 2020 election.\n\nThis divide is almost entirely explained by whether a pollster uses \u201cweighting on recalled vote,\u201d which means trying to account for how voters\u00a0*say*\u00a0they voted in the last election.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. First, the pollster asks respondents whether they voted for Joe Biden or Mr. Trump in the last election. Then they use a statistical technique called weighting, in which pollsters give more or less \u201cweight\u201d to respondents from different demographic groups, such that each group represents its actual share of the population. In this case, the pollster weights the number of Biden \u201920 or Trump \u201920 voters to match the outcome of the last election.\n\nThis approach had long been considered a mistake. For reasons we\u2019ll explain, pollsters have avoided it over the years. But they increasingly do it today, partly as a way to try to make sure they have enough Trump supporters after high-profile polling misfires in 2016 and 2020. The choice has become an important fault line among pollsters in this election, and it helps explain the whiplash that poll watchers are experiencing from day to day.\n\n**Over the last month, about two-thirds of polls were weighted by recalled vote.**\n\nAn important \u2014 and perhaps obvious \u2014 consequence of weighting by recalled vote is that it makes poll results look more like the 2020 election results. The polls that don\u2019t\u00a0do it\\*,\\*\u00a0including New York Times/Siena College surveys, are more likely to show clear changes from four years ago.\n\nWhile the differences between the two sets of polls are relatively small, they add up to two different stories of the election. The polls that\u00a0*don\u2019t*\u00a0weight on past vote tend to show results that align more closely with the result of the 2022 midterm election than the last presidential election. They also show that Mr. Trump\u2019s advantage in the Electoral College, with respect to the popular vote, has dwindled over the last four years. The polls weighted on past vote, on the other hand, show little more than a 2020 repeat of the Electoral College gap.\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, this is a fraught decision for pollsters. On one hand, weighting on recalled vote would have produced worse results in every presidential election from 2004 to 2020. On the other, it\u2019s the choice that might save pollsters from underestimating Mr. Trump yet again.\n\n**Why this kind of weighting is controversial**\n\nWhen I started following polling methodology debates 20 years ago, weighting on recalled vote was considered a very bad idea. A surprising number of respondents don\u2019t remember how they voted; they seem likelier to remember voting for the winner; and they sometimes report voting when voting records show they did not.\n\nThis pattern has persisted all the way from the first time I read about recall vote all the way to the present, based on data archived at the Roper Center and 2021-24 data from the Pew Research Center and Times/Siena. The same pattern shows up in the exit polls in every presidential election year when it was asked (2004, 2008, 2020).\n\nThe tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the last election means that weighting on recall vote has a predictable effect: It increases support for the party that lost the last election.\n\nWhile polls have a lot of issues, underestimating the party that lost the last election doesn\u2019t turn out to be one of them. As a result, weighting on recalled vote would have made the polls less accurate in every election since 2004 (the farthest back considered), based on a re-analysis of 70 polls archived at the Roper Center.\n\nThe effect of recall vote in 2020 is especially revealing: The polls that year were so poor that there are individual cases where recall-vote weighting would have helped. For example, it would have produced a smaller lead for Mr. Biden in ABC/Washington Post\u2019s\u00a0[infamous poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/28/power-up-new-post-abc-polling-shows-biden-with-big-lead-wisconsin-where-coronavirus-cases-are-rising/)\u00a0showing him leading by 17 points in Wisconsin in October 2020. But it wouldn\u2019t have fixed it, either; by our estimate, it would have still shown Mr. Biden up 12 if recall vote had been used when producing the result. And it would have made most other 2020 polls less accurate, on average, including Times/Siena polls and most of the other ABC/Post polls.\n\nWhat does it mean if recall vote wouldn\u2019t have been enough to fix the polls four years ago? The most straightforward interpretation: For the 2020 polls to be right, pollsters needed the 2016 recall vote to look \u201cwrong.\u201d The polls needed Mr. Trump to hold a clear lead on recall vote \u2014 exactly what one would have expected historically, given the tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the previous election.\n\nAs a result, recalled vote didn\u2019t even help the polls in the biggest polling misfire in 40 years.\n\n**Why pollsters now weight on recall vote**\n\nDespite that record, many pollsters have decided to weight on recall vote for four main reasons.\n\nFirst, many pollsters believe recall vote is more reliable than it used to be. Whether it\u2019s accurate enough is another question, but it\u2019s certainly true that recall vote looks \u201ccloser\u201d to the last election result than in prior cycles. The last three years of Times/Siena and Pew Research NPORS data show about a three-point gap between recalled 2020 vote and the actual 2020 result, a far cry from the double-digit differences a decade or two ago.\n\nWhy could recall vote be getting more accurate? One possibility is that poll respondents have become more likely to remember whom they voted for in the last election, thanks to rising political engagement and polarization. Another possibility is that data collected online may be less vulnerable to whatever it is that causes the \u201cwinner bias\u201d (importantly, almost all the reanalyzed polls \u2014 where we produced estimates of what a poll\u2019s result might be if it had used recall-vote weighting \u2014 were telephone surveys).\n\nThis election also features a novel case: The loser of the last election is running again (and most Republicans don\u2019t even believe he lost), and the winner of the last election just lost a rematch, in a sense, against that loser. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how all of this affects the accuracy of recall vote, but it is easy to imagine further mitigation of the traditional \u201cwinner bias.\u201d\n\nSecond, some pollsters use panels of repeat survey-takers, which means they have responses from them over a long period. A pollster may have asked panelists in 2020 how they voted, as opposed to asking them today to remember how they voted four years ago. This counts as weighting on past vote, but it\u2019s not quite the same as someone\u2019s recalled vote. This approach ought to be less vulnerable to the biases in recall-vote weighting, even if there are still challenges involved \u2014 like what to do about any new panelists or changes in the makeup of the electorate since 2020.\n\nThird, recall vote can be used to bludgeon self-evidently unrepresentative data toward a more plausible result. This is especially useful for survey designs with no plausible case for validity, like a poll of people from a single social media platform. No one expects such an approach to yield a good sample, but recall-vote weighting can quickly get it into the ballpark. Indeed, more than 80 percent of opt-in online panel polls weight on recall vote, while other kinds of polls are less likely to do so.\n\nFourth, recall vote is being used to help address the tendency for polls to understate Mr. Trump\u2019s strength over the last eight years.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, weighting on recall vote historically helps the candidate who lost the last election. This year, that\u2019s Mr. Trump. You can see it for yourself in the last round of Times/Siena battleground state polls \u2014 almost all of them would have scooted to the right if they had been weighted by recall vote:\n\n**How recent Times/Siena polls would have changed**\n\n* Pennsylvania: Harris +4 (without recall vote) \u2014> Trump +1 (with recall vote)\n* Michigan: Harris +1 \u2014> Trump +1\n* Wisconsin: Harris +2 \u2014> Trump +1\n* North Carolina: Trump +3 \u2014> Trump +6\n* Arizona: Trump +5 \u2014> Trump +3\n* Georgia: Trump +4 \u2014> Trump +6\n\nOf course, the recall-vote-weighted poll results here represent an entirely plausible outcome. If the polls underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did four or eight years ago, November\u2019s results might look exactly like this. But historically, it\u2019s not surprising that weighting on recall vote would help Republicans: Mr. Trump lost the last election; as such, weighting on recall vote would be expected to give more weight to Trump \u201920 voters, and therefore to Mr. Trump today.\n\nWhen big-name traditional pollsters weight by recall vote, this is usually the reason. Some of these pollsters think it\u2019s a perfectly valid measure, but many only use it grudgingly. They still more or less believe the old arguments against recall vote, but they choose to employ it anyway. They wouldn\u2019t be doing it if they trusted their data to produce unbiased results, and they wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it didn\u2019t shift their polls toward Mr. Trump.\n\nAs Patrick Murray of the Monmouth poll put it in\u00a0[explaining](https://x.com/PollsterPatrick/status/1824477952043618633)\u00a0his decision to weight on recall vote, \u201cThe Trump phenomenon is sui generis, and you have to pick your poison.\u201d\n\n**Did recall vote fix past problems?**\n\nThere is some good news contained in this story: Recall-vote weighting is almost certainly reducing the risk that the polls systematically underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did in 2016 or 2020. As we\u2019ve shown, it has given many pollsters a quick and easy fix to move their numbers toward the right.\n\nMany of the worst survey results of the 2020 election seem unlikely to be repeated this time around. For instance, The Washington Post and CNN/SSRS state polls now weight by recall vote, which means we won\u2019t be seeing any results like Biden +17 in Wisconsin or Biden +16 nationwide.\n\nBut there\u2019s a strange contradiction between the two major observations so far \u2014 and the contradiction points toward real trade-offs involving recall-vote weighting.\n\nOn the one hand, many pollsters are weighting on recall vote because it yields more Republican-leaning results.\n\nOn the other, the polls weighted like this aren\u2019t necessarily producing especially Republican-leaning results. They don\u2019t look like the hypothetical recall-weighted Times/Siena polls, for instance. Instead, they\u2019re producing results neatly in line with the result of the 2020 election.\n\n**How is that possible? There are two basic possibilities.**\n\nOne is that the polls weighted on recall vote are full of highly engaged voters who haven\u2019t shifted since 2020, and therefore weighting on recall vote will produce a 2020 repeat.\n\nAnother possibility: It may be employed selectively by pollsters concerned their data is too far to the left. The two theories could be connected, as highly engaged voters have leaned left during the Trump era. Weighting on recall vote, then, would move a group of relatively Democratic-leaning samples neatly in line with the 2020 election result.\n\nWhatever the explanation, this tension suggests significant trade-offs as pollsters weight on recall vote. Most obviously, it may make it harder to identify any changes since the last election. One reason is simply because recall-vote weighting mechanically forces polls toward the last election result. But even deeper than that, the technique is being used, at least in part, because pollsters don\u2019t trust their survey results. It\u2019s an attitude that can lead pollsters to treat surprising and unusual data as suspicious, rather than potentially newsworthy or insightful. This is understandable: I know I don\u2019t always trust our survey results after the last decade of polling misfires. But when legitimate concern about polling morphs into weighting away otherwise outlying findings, it risks squelching any indication of anything that might be out of the ordinary.\n\nIn a way, the problem is reminiscent of something\u00a0[called \u201cherding,\u201d](https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Herding-508.pdf)\u00a0in which pollsters tweak their surveys to bring their results into alignment with the average of other polls. Like herding, the decision to weight on past vote is often a reflection of how pollsters feel about the quality of their underlying data. In this case, however, pollsters aren\u2019t necessarily herding toward what other pollsters say. Instead, they\u2019re essentially herding toward the result of the last presidential election.\n\nA near repeat of the last presidential election is certainly a plausible outcome. In today\u2019s polarized era, who could possibly be surprised by a repeat in Mr. Trump\u2019s third presidential run? If it\u2019s a near repeat, the polls weighted by recall vote won\u2019t just have an excellent night themselves, but they might also spare the entire industry another four years of misery.\n\nBut if this election is different, in any direction, this year\u2019s polls might not be able to see it coming.",

Arguably Federal Chancellor Theobald van Bethmann Hollweg could be said to be like that too. \n\nEdit: Note that technocratic government doesn't say whether the actual leader is some sort of scientific genius, it's just that they have no partisan background and is merely there to administer legislation with essentially no original ideas. They have more of a mandate to make choices than judges but they are still mostly dependent on the parties in parliament or Congress for direction and legitimacy.

Technocratic government in this context is about the origin of policy direction, which in a technocratic government has essentially nothing to do with the executive as they just apply the law as written, leaving the political initiative to do anything to the party leaders and the legislators. They keep things the way they run normally except as the political will is expressed by the partisans. No person is completely impartial, but they are generally accepted by most of the parties, and are not usually tied to any party's membership or electoral campaign, and held positions of respect like the chair of a central bank or the director of an intelligence council, and they don't have support from sources except through what they independently prove by achieving results in their administration and the confidence the parties have in them. They aren't going to popular rallies, people often have little interest in the technocratic leader and would not side with them in any political showdown, and no party claims them as one of their own, and they don't have a bunch of bureaucrats or governors loyal to them nor is their support from the military or espionage agencies.

Many of the so-called \"Reagan Democrats\" were from Eastern European diasporas in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and other Great Lakes states and supported the famously anti-Soviet Ronald Reagan even while voting for Democrats at the state and local level.

Instead, that role seems reserved for the Polish vote, which also of course happens to be predominantly Catholic.  It's thus no coincidence that Poland has become America's closest ally in Eastern Europe.  From my experience in Poland, the Polish psyche cannot comprehend being left alone by the United States.

        "content": "There is a call by public figures for more government control of social media outlets.\n\nIn a recent CNN interview, the discussion focused on the growing calls for more regulation of social media companies. Lawmakers and experts highlighted the need for tighter oversight to address issues like misinformation, privacy concerns, and the platforms' role in amplifying harmful content. They pointed to the influence of these companies on public opinion, elections, and mental health, especially among younger users. Proposals for regulation include stronger data privacy laws, increased transparency around algorithms, and measures to combat the spread of disinformation. The interview also touched on the challenge of balancing regulation with free speech and innovation, as well as the global nature of these platforms, making regulation complex. Social media executives, in response, have expressed openness to working with governments but emphasize the need for careful, well-considered regulation that doesn\u2019t stifle their platforms' ability to operate effectively.",

It would require large-scale infrastructure for storage and maintenance, but could this be a more responsible way to handle plastic waste while waiting for innovations to catch up?\n\nI\u2019m curious about the practicalities of this idea, especially regarding environmental impact, cost, land use, and whether it\u2019s a good use of resources.

If the DOE closed, and a state chose not to compensate for the loss of funding to small and rural schools, how much funding would any given school district or county have to raise for itself?\n\nAlso, what other programs might cause issues? Would some programs and services need to be started at local levels?   \n",

        "content": "When talking about international politics, we often hear and say things like \u201cdoing A is in the national interests of the country B\u201d, \u201ccountry C is protecting its interests by allying with the country D\u201d etc.\n\nBut if you think about it for a moment, what do the \u201cnational interests\u201d actually mean? A single action can benefit some people within a nation, and harm others. For example, setting tariffs on import will benefit producers, but harm consumers, going to a war on the other side of the globe might be beneficial for arms manufacturers, not so much for the people who might be forced to go there, in case there\u2019s conscription, etc.\n\nSo if we define \u201cnational interests\u201d as something that, if achieved, would benefit every citizen of a given country, then I am afraid those things practically don\u2019t exist.\n\nIf we define it as the interests of the ruling elites, then it sounds contrary to the idea of that they are supposed to mean. Besides, different people and fractions within the ruling class can have interests that conflict with each other.\n\nSo what do you think the \u201cnational interests\u201d mean in general? Is it even a useful term when discussing geopolitics? Can we predicts country\u2019s behaviour based on their \u201cnational interests\u201d?\n\nThank you!",

This was the one they had meant to agree to, although some relatively last minute changes affected the plan, and it wouldn't be too crazy to imagine the draft I linked to being the one going to ratification conventions.\n\nThe structure in general doesn't look so different and had agreed on many similar things to today, but there are differences. The Congress directly elects the President for a seven year term, and they cannot serve multiple terms which is meant to keep  them independent of congress, and the House of Representatives impeached but the Supreme Court convicts, and the Senate elects the Supreme Court judges for life. The Senate also makes treaties and appoints ambassadors. \n\nThe three-fifths clause is basically as it was enacted in the end, but they substitute limiting navigation acts to needing 2/3 of Congress to agree in return for not having the fugitive slave clause. I imagine the tariffs necessary fund the basics of the federal government would have been enacted anyway given that all states but Rhode Island did agree to such a concept 5 years before but not the tariffs that would later lead to controversy like the one that got South Carolina angry when Jackson was president. And I imagine that the US would not be in a position to do something like an embargo that they tried when Jefferson was president.\n\nMost states did ultimately have governors elected by the legislature back then, although not for terms exceeding 3 years, and many of them did have the legislature elect the judges and not the governor, with or without the advice and consent of a council or legislature. And in our own real timeline, the members of Congres of a particular party were for decades the ones who actually suggested the nomination of particular individuals to be their nominee for president in the electoral college, and many legislatures of the states simply went along with that, only a few held direct ballots for decades.",

President Biden has spent the past two+ years making the case that Trump is a unique threat to democracy. The man has been found guilty of 30+ felonies and is currently under federal indictment pursuant to both the Espionage Act and for **attempting a coup**.  More still, he is under indictment by Biden\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nObama\u2019s letter to Trump was seemingly an attempt to get him to rise to his office. From Biden\u2019s perspective, that won\u2019t happen. He had his shot, he missed it, and is now trying to dismantle the Republic to protect himself from prosecution (at least that is how Biden would likely view it).\n\nSo that in mind, I feel like this an interesting way to frame the question of Trump\u2019s second term:\n\nIf you were Joe Biden, what would you write in your transition letter to Donald Trump?",

As an everyday person who spends quite a bit of time on Reddit and podcasts, I\u2019m looking for a perspective without the fear of judgment. Reddit seems like the perfect place for that discussion.\n\n**Understanding the Connection**\n\n**The Role of Religion:** Religion has historically been a unifying force for communities and nations, often shaping identities long before the concept of democracy emerged. In both India and the USA, religious beliefs influence cultural norms and political ideologies.\n\nWhile Hindu nationalism in India and Christian nationalism in the USA are prominent examples, the tension between religious identity and democratic values transcends specific faiths and can be seen in various contexts worldwide.\n\n**Nationalism vs. Democracy**: Nationalism often emphasizes unity and cultural homogeneity, which can conflict with the democratic principles of pluralism and individual rights. Extreme forms of nationalism may view democracy as a threat to a perceived cultural or religious purity, leading to the marginalization of minority groups.\n\nThis sentiment is observable in India, where Hindu nationalism may prioritize a Hindu identity over a secular state, and in the USA, where populist movements sometimes appeal to a specific vision of American identity rooted in certain religious and cultural values.\n\n**The Impact on Democratic Institutions**\n\n**Erosion of Democratic Norms**: In India, there are concerns that the rise of Hindu nationalism has led to a weakening of democratic institutions, including challenges to judicial independence and freedom of the press.\n\nSimilarly, in the USA, the focus on nationalism has raised questions about electoral integrity and the treatment of dissenting voices, leading to fears about the future of democratic governance.\n\n**Exclusionary Practices**: In both nations, policies have emerged that reflect a desire for cultural or religious homogeneity, potentially undermining the rights of minorities. In India, laws such as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) have faced criticism for allegedly prioritizing certain religious identities over others.\n\nIn the USA, immigration policies influenced by nationalist rhetoric have resulted in the exclusion and vilification of immigrant communities, often framed in religious or cultural terms.\n\n**A Broader Perspective:** These issues are not confined to India and the USA; similar patterns are evident globally, as nationalism often seeks to dismantle democratic structures in favor of a more unified, sometimes exclusionary, vision of society. Countries around the world face the challenge of balancing national identity with democratic ideals.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs nationalism rises, the principles of democracy\u2014freedom, equality, and pluralism\u2014are often put to the test. Understanding the interplay between nationalism, religion, and democracy is crucial for safeguarding these values.\n\n**Do you think young democracy can stand up to long-established religions and nationalism?**\n\n**How do you think religion shapes our understanding of national identity in your country?**\n\n**In what ways can nationalism enhance or threaten the principles of democracy?**\n\n**What do you believe is more important: cultural unity or individual rights?**",

        "title": "Have Democrats and Republicans Made Good Faith Efforts on Immigration Reform?",
        "content": "Immigration reform has been a highly polarizing issue in U.S. politics, and each party claims to have the best approach. I'd like to initiate a civil, balanced discussion about whether either party has made good faith efforts to tackle immigration reform. Here are some specific questions I have:\n\n1. Have Democrats Made Good Faith Efforts at Immigration Reform?\n\nHistorically, the Democratic Party has supported more progressive immigration policies. During President Biden\u2019s administration, several measures have been proposed, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and a focus on more humanitarian asylum policies. However, critics argue that some of these policies could encourage illegal immigration. How sincere are these efforts, and have they been accompanied by realistic enforcement measures?\n\nExample: The Biden administration proposed the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. Supporters argue this is a compassionate, necessary solution, while critics say it lacks strong border security measures.\n\n2. Did Immigration Get Out of Hand During the Biden Administration?\n\nMy understanding is that the southern border has faced increased pressure since Biden took office. Some claim that his administration\u2019s rollback of Trump-era policies, such as \"Remain in Mexico,\" has caused a spike in illegal border crossings. However, others argue that external factors, like violence in Central America and economic crises, are major drivers that any administration would struggle to control.\n\nIs the surge at the border directly tied to Biden\u2019s policies, or is this a more complex issue beyond any single administration\u2019s control?\n\n3. Do Democrats Have Something to Gain from Unchecked Illegal Immigration?\n\nA common argument from critics, is that Democrats might benefit politically from increased illegal immigration, potentially gaining votes if immigrants are naturalized and able to vote in the future. Is there any credible evidence that Democrats support more lenient immigration policies for this purpose, or is this purely speculation?\n\n4. Is There Evidence of Illegal Immigrants Voting in U.S. Elections?\n\nVoter fraud, particularly involving non-citizens, is a frequent concern raised in immigration debates. However, research on this is mixed. Multiple studies have shown that instances of illegal immigrants voting are rare and often exaggerated, yet some Republican lawmakers continue to push for stricter voter ID laws.\n\nIs there any significant, verifiable evidence that illegal immigrants are participating in U.S. elections in numbers large enough to influence outcomes?\n\n5. Does Proposed Legislation Contain Unreasonable Clauses Leading to Justified Republican Opposition?\n\nMany immigration reform bills introduced by Democrats have faced opposition from Republicans, some claiming that the provisions are simply too lenient or impractical. For instance, the Biden administration's immigration proposals include a clause requiring the processing of at least 3,000 immigrants per day at the border. Critics argue this creates an incentive for more illegal crossings and overwhelms the system.\n\nIs this opposition justifiable? Are there elements in these bills that Republicans could reasonably argue would make border enforcement ineffective?\n\n6. Have Republicans Made Good Faith Efforts on Immigration Reform?\n\nRepublicans typically focus more on border security and strict enforcement. During Trump\u2019s presidency, initiatives like the border wall and family separation policies were implemented to deter illegal immigration. However, comprehensive immigration reform, which balances security with addressing the status of undocumented immigrants already in the country, did not occur under Trump or previous Republican administrations.\n\nDo Republican proposals overly focus on enforcement at the expense of addressing the full scope of the issue? Are there credible bipartisan efforts from Republicans to find a middle ground?\n\n7. What Are the Incentives for Both Parties to Solve or Block Solutions to Illegal Immigration?\n\nFinally, let\u2019s consider the political incentives for both parties. Some argue that Democrats benefit from a more lenient stance, appealing to immigrant communities, while Republicans benefit from maintaining a hardline approach to satisfy their base\u2019s demand for strict enforcement. Both parties may also use the issue as a political weapon against each other.\n\nAre these motivations driving a lack of real progress on immigration reform?\n\n\nSources and Context:\n\n1.

Additionally, the latter two countries mentioned above (Ukraine and Georgia) both have their own border disputes with Russia, meaning that NATO would either have to recognize Russian territorial claims, make a special exclusion rule of the occupied territories, or wait for the Russians to be expelled from the regions they currently occupy for either of those countries to be admitted.\n\nThere have been other countries discussed as well for admission; Azerbaijan is often one that comes up, given it's close ties with Turkey and Israel, and it's opposition to Armenia (a member of the Russian-led CSTO alliance). Moldova has also been discussed both in its own right and a possibility via reunion with Romania, but it too has a border dispute with Russia (through Transnistria).",

In some cases this will be the same party, in others they won't be. Statements by individual legislators for promises only apply to bringing forth promises for their particular district such as funding a project in the district or getting a particular form of wording into the bills and proposals that get enacted that they promised to include unless they are promises made by their party as a whole and the legislator is speaking in reference to that common platform. Bonus points for those who can enact their proposals as an amendment to the constitution of the state, and also bonus points to those who can enact their ideas in statutory law (or the budget passed by the legislators) and which are less likely to be repealed by successors.\n\nPolitifact has a promise tracker for presidents. Biden is sitting at about 28% of his approved in its full form and 10% adopted as a compromise solution.

There's almost a 99% chance that the presidency is won by either of the two major parties in the United States. Most people are unaware that they have other options besides the two mainstream Democratic and Republican candidates. This is probably because when the mainstream media covers presidential elections, they tend to focus on just those two and not bring up any third party, although I think the only third-party candidate that seemed to get some coverage by the mainstream media is RFK Jr. before he dropped out.\n\nLet's suppose in a very unlikely scenario, a third-party unexpectedly wins the presidency. What happens now since they have been elected? Will we see political polarization increase or decrease? Would there be social unrest? How effective would they be as president? Will they be able to pass legislation with a two-party Congress? Would they be able to carry out their agenda? These questions would be good starters to get the discussion going in the comments below.",

So the claim she's \"slightly behind in the popular vote\" was not accurate.  But you can see the results I was thinking about here:  https://www.realclearpolling.com/latest-polls\n\nSo, my bad on that.  However, things are still so close that I don't think the premise is that far out of bounds.  We know some Republican states are doing whatever possible to suppress Democratic turnout.

She talked about Trump\u2019s role in blocking Joe Biden\u2019s border deal, and offered no solutions of her own. She was then asked why voters do not trust her to tackle inflation, and she talked about Trump\u2019s economic plan, not her own. A question about transgender operations in federal prisons produced a response about Trump. Even in the most newsworthy section of the interview, about how her White House would differ from Mr Biden\u2019s, Ms Harris suggested she would avoid \u201cthe kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump\u201d. It is hard to imagine that this strategy was compelling for Fox News viewers, who are almost all likely to think Trump\u2019s policy positions are at the least defensible, more probably laudable. Ms Harris has spent weeks on the back foot, unable to answer detailed policy questions even in softball interviews with Left-wing outlets. When she finally sat down with Fox, she could only attack the man the network most supports.\n\nThe Daily Wire: [Kamala Harris Fumes When Confronted Over Covering Up Biden\u2019s Cognitive Decline](https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamala-harris-fumes-when-confronted-over-covering-up-bidens-cognitive-decline)\n\n> \u201cYou told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, that [he] ran around circles on his staff,\u201d Baier noted. \u201cWhen did you first notice that President Biden\u2019s mental faculties appeared diminished?\u201d\n\n> Baier\u2019s question came after Biden was forced out of the presidential race by the Democrat Party following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump.\n\n> Harris flashed a deer-in-the-headlights look when asked the question, and paused for a moment before answering.\n\n> \u201cJoe Biden, I have watched in \u2014 from the Oval Office to the Situation Room, and he has the judgment and the experiment \u2014 and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people,\u201d Harris claimed.\n\n> Baier pushed back: \u201cThere were no concerns raised?\u201d\n\n> Harris snapped back: \u201cBret, Joe Biden is not on the ballot.\u201d\n\nBreitbart: [Bret Baier Questions Rattled Kamala Harris on Deadly Consequences of Her Open Border Policies in Fox News Interview](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/16/bret-baier-questions-rattled-kamala-harris-on-deadly-consequences-of-her-open-border-policies-in-fox-news-interview/)\n\n> \u201cDo you regret the decision to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration, at the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath?

So that is true,\u201d Harris said, not apologizing to the victims. \n\n> \u201cSo do you owe them an apology?\u201d he asked again. \n\n> \u201cWhat I should tell you, that I am so sorry for her loss. I\u2019m so sorry for her loss, sincerely,\u201d she said. \n\n> Harris then claimed that \u201cCongress, ultimately, is the only place that that\u2019s going to get fixed.\u201d\n\nThe Federalist: [That Fox News Interview May Have Done To Kamala What The Debate Did To Biden](https://thefederalist.com/2024/10/16/that-fox-news-interview-may-have-done-to-kamala-what-the-debate-did-to-biden/)\n\n> There\u2019s no longer any denying that she\u2019s a mindless, superficial candidate who instills no confidence.\n\n> What happened Wednesday night to Kamala Harris on Fox News may have been the equivalent to what happened to President Joe Biden at that infamous debate in June \u2014 irreparably exposed her as unacceptable to voters.\n\n> In what was widely seen as a Hail Mary move by Kamala\u2019s campaign, the vice president agreed to an extended interview on Fox News, one of the exceedingly few national TV interviews she\u2019s done since she was anointed the Democrat Party\u2019s post-Biden nominee. Remarkably, she offered nothing new in terms of her weak, often confusing answers to obvious questions, but she did finally face probing lines of inquiry and necessary follow-up when time after time she attempted to change the subject from her performance in the White House to attacks on Donald Trump.\n\n> The entire interview was tense, an obvious effort by \u201cSpecial Report\u201d anchor Bret Baier to wring direct answers out of Kamala on questions that for months she has responded to with professions of her \u201cmiddle-class family,\u201d and her delight in the \u201cambitions,\u201d \u201cdreams\u201d and \u201caspirations\u201d of Americans. She was visibly upset and exasperated by the countless interruptions and redirections, but only because until then she had faced none.\n\nNewsmax: [Harris Blames Trump for Country 'Being on the Wrong Track'](https://www.newsmax.com/politics/harris-interview-trump/2024/10/16/id/1184351/)\n\n> Vice President Kamala Harris blamed former President Donald Trump for the country's woes over the past 3 1/2 years during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday.\n\n> In her first sit-down interview with a Fox News reporter, Harris provided lengthy, sometimes tense answers with little substance in an effort to challenge Baier's line of questioning.\n\n> Baier reminded Harris that 79% of the American public feel the country is on the wrong track.\n\n> \"If it's on the wrong track, that track follows 3 1/2 years of you being vice president and [Joe] Biden being president. Why are they saying that, if you are turning the page? You have been in office for 3 1/2 years,\" he said.\n\n> Harris replied, \"And Donald Trump has been running for office since.\"\n\n> When Baier reminded the vice president that she was the individual who has been holding an office of government authority, Harris replied, \"Come on, you and I both know what I'm talking about.\"\n\n> Baier pressed further, \"I actually don't. What are you talking about?\"\n\nSample comments from /conservative.\n\n> Did she forget who\u2019s been in charge for the last four years?\n\n> Good lord\u2026 she\u2019s so out of touch with reality. They will never understand what it\u2019s like to be middle class. Ever.\n\n> That whole interview was Harris complaining about Trump and \"being very clear\" on everything...\n\n> I see literally zero redeeming qualities for Harris. She says literally nothing of value, she\u2019s incoherent, she\u2019s patronizing in tone, she deflects questions, she laughs randomly, and she can\u2019t stay focused. I just simply can\u2019t understand how anyone can vote for her.\n\n> That was a bad one. \"Reversing Trump's remain in Mexico policy got my kid killed three years ago.\" Kamala: Okay, but if we'd passed my border bill nine months ago we'd better off today. \"The border patrol supports Trump.\" Kamala: They're frustrated. What?\n\n> If she can't even handle a tough interview, how the hell is she going to handle world leaders?\n\n> She blew the interview in a strategic sense. Her answers to criticism should have been about how she has evolved and wants to turn the page. Instead, Harris simply replied \"But Trump\" and tried to hamfistedly give her stump speech talking points over Baier's pushback.\n\n> I love how immigration ain\u2019t her fault at all. Had no part in it. They \u201cThey her and Biden were doing everything that they could to fix immigration. The entire time from when they took office.\u201d I swear to god. How can ANYONE say the left doesn\u2019t own or border situation and illegal immigration situation. I don\u2019t care if you love or hate her.\n\n> So, she apparently finally got the message that she needs to distance herself from the current administration's policies after weeks if not months of it being brought up and yet she still can't name anything she'd do differently echoing her statement on The View. Everything was turned back to Trump or deflected entirely despite that not tracking with the people who watch Fox. A very strange strategy if you can even call it that.\n\n> Kamala\u2019s getting cooked, her honeymoon is over and she\u2019s losing her support\n\n> I listened to it in its entirety. She literally answered not a single question (until it got to \"Iran\" at the very end). Instead, it was literally all \"Trump bad!\"\n\nAre these analyses accurate? Do you agree with them?",

She went from not being taken seriously as a candidate to generating way more voter enthusiasm than Biden ever could.

Historically the support for restricting it is traditionally associated with the GOP. Combine that with their own insistence on returning the issue to the states who then immediately begin trying to enforce anti-abortion restrictions and the consequences (such as the two women in Georgia) being traced back to them at a national level.\n\nVery much seems like a dog caught the car kind of moment so it would make an amount of sense to try to pivot away.\n\nBut the sticking point for me is that the GOP has relied on the evangelical voting bloc for decades now to help them in elections. If they soften their stance on this at a party level do you think the evangelicals will abandon them? Will they stick around and begrudgingly vote? Did a large chunk of the evangelical vote already leave because Roe v Wade was overturned?\n\nOr is this a purely cynical political move by the GOP that will only last until the POTUS election is done?\n\nI have spoken to and seen Republicans who really seem to believe that the GOP is ready to leave the Evangelicals behind already on the matter of IVF.

Sachs also mentioned our failing domestic state and how we, the US government, should place more emphasis on domestic development. \n\nIt reminded of the America First Agenda. Under an America First Agenda purportedly carried out by the Trump Administration, there were significant domestic policies implemented: tightening immigration and refugee policies, the reorganization of NAFTA, and the Tariffs were actually significant in my opinion, even from a nominal or aesthetic stance, it sent a message. However, it seemed that we still placed foreign policy at the forefront of our agenda even under an America First administration: Abraham Accords, Jerusalem Embassy, Syria and Iran Strikes, Afghan Missions. I was anticipating a rather aggressive domestic policy that significantly and positively impacted the lives of the majority of hourly-working-wage Americans, let alone improving infrastructure or access to affordable and reliable healthcare. \n\nGiven the current geopolitical climate which the United States is directly involved in (Russia+Ukraine and Israel+Gaza+Lebanon+Iran), how can either Political Administration implement an America First / Non-Interventionist Agenda whilst supporting allies and proxies?\n\nI am not here to debate the validity of America 's intervention into geopolitical proxy wars with Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran, China, and Taiwan.   \n  \nI am asking from the perspective of a global superpower.

Or are both parties lying to the American people and only offering at best aesthetic incremental policies that keep Americans distracted or placated for 4 years with a small temporary tax cut, tighter immigration at the border, or a small child tax credit increase, without addressing other major systemic domestic issues? \n\n  \n",

I just want to find some impartial information or a place where you can have a balanced discussion, but it feels impossible.\n\nFor example, on Twitter, the second you say anything remotely positive about Kamala Harris, you get swarmed by angry replies and to be honest racist and abusive comments.\n\nMeanwhile, if you so much as hint at anything good about Trump on Reddit, the downvotes come in like clockwork.\n\nIt\u2019s like people just can\u2019t handle anyone thinking differently. So, does anyone know of a space where people can actually talk about politics without immediately jumping down your throat? Or is that too much to ask these days?",

America\u2019s first black president, Obergefell v Hodges, the ACA, Me Too, and advanced conversations on race relations in America have all taken place generally in the same political era.\nTrump is definitely a new political era that defined a swing in at least quasi-conservative ways. A powerful-yet-troubled Democrat candidate lost in 2016, massive deregulation takes place, and Republicans briefly held both halves of congress and for the foreseeable future have made SCOTUS overwhelmingly conservative.\nDespite Trump\u2019s own electability issues marked not just by his rhetoric but also by his historically abysmal record, he\u2019s still statistically tied for 2024 and could be only the second president to lose a second term but come back four years later. By rights this shouldn\u2019t even be close.\n\nAre we living in unique times that can\u2019t be defined conventionally, or is America just undergoing a sort of conservative reformation?",

        "content": "This presidential election has pretty much been down to two major candidates between Harris and Trump. Based on the endless news states and articles online tend to focus on the two major candidates. Third-party candidates are not invited to debates since they have a hard time meeting the polling requirements to be considered for a debate. There is a 99% chance that one of the two mainstream party candidates wins the presidency, but I'm sure voting third-party can have some advantages, despite the very low chance they have at actually winning the presidency, such as showing dissatisfaction with the two-party system and voting for someone you actually believe in rather than voting for one of the two candidates you don't share their values.\n\nWhat factors should people take in when deciding who to vote for? This question is very different for every voter since it is a very personal decision, and every person has their own system on who gets their vote. For some, it's not about personality, it's about their policies and achieving results while in office. For others, it's about their platform and not just the person, but who they will appoint to their Cabinet as well as judges and justices on the Supreme Court.
